    <h1>Hindi</h1>
    
    <p>Hindi is a modern Indo-Aryan language (belonging to the family of greater Indo-European languages) and is a descendant of Sanskrit, the earliest speech of the Aryan settlers in the north-west frontiers of India.

 Passing through various stages of evolution over the period of time -- from Classical Sanskrit to Pali-Prakrit and Apabhransha, the emergence of Hindi in its earliest form can be traced back to the 10th century A.D. Hindi, sometimes, is also refered to as Hindavi, Hindustani and Khari-Boli. Hindi is written in Devanagari script (which is the most scientific writing system among the existing writing systems of the world) is the Official Language of the Republic of India and is ranked as the third most widely spoken languages of the world . In addition, Hindi is also the state language of the state of Bihar, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. Approximately six hundred million people across the globe speak Hindi as either a first or second language. 

The literary history of Hindi can be traced back to the twelfth century and in its modern incarnation Hindi has an approximately three hundred year old, well attested rich literary and grammatical tradition. 
</p>
<p>
Three distinct phases in the development of Indo-Aryan languages have been suggested by the scholars.They are : 
<ul>
<li>(a) the Ancient (2400 BC - 500 BC) </li>
<li>(b) the Medieval (500 BC - 1100 AD)</li>
<li>(c) the Modern (1100 - Present )</li> 
</ul>
The ancient period is the period of the Vedic and Classical Sanskrit which resulted in the evolution of Pali, Prakrit and Apabhransha languages during the medieval period. Most of the modern Indo-Aryan languages of south Asia, like Hindi, Bangla, Oriya, Gujrati, Nepali, Marathi, Punjabi, evolved in the 'modern' period.

It is very difficult to say as to when exactly Hindi as a language came into picture and scholars are divided in their opinion on this issue. But the trace of Hindi is obvious in the langauge of the Siddh saints of century 8 - 9 AD. Noted Hindi scholar Acharya Ramchandra Shukla begins his description of the history of Hindi literature ('Hindi Sahitya ka Itihas'). In order to make their teaching easily understandable to the common ordinary people, the kind of language Sindh saints used is can undoubtedly be called the one of the authentic earliest forms of Hindi. We can also find the glimpse of early Hindi in the langauge of the Jain poets (like Hemchandra and Dharma Suri), Vidyapati, Abdurrehman Khankhana and Swayambhu. The more established form of Hindi (the 'khari boli') is visible in the creations of Sharfuddin, Khusro, Banda Niwaz Gailurdaz, Wjahi Ali, Sultan Kuli Qutabshah, Shah Turab etc.

The modern Hindi and its literary tradition evolved towards the end of the 18th century. Fort William College was established in Calcutta by the British East India Company. The principle of this college John Gilchrist wrote a grammar of and compiled a dictionary of Hindi to teach and train the BEIC employees the Hindi language. Some newpapers and journals were published in Hindi around that time, many of them were confiscated by the British government (for alleged anti British propaganda). 

The first Hindi newspaper 'Udant Martanda' was published in 1826 from Calcutta. At the same time, authors like Raja Shivprasad Sitare Hind and Raja Lakshman Singh had established new trends in Hindi literature. Later on, Hindi became the national symbol in the fight against the British colonial rule. Many Indian leaders (including Gandhiji), revolutionaries, poets and reformists resorted to Hindi to propagate their ideology.

After after independence (Aug 15, 1947), the new constitution was adopted in India on January 26, 1950 which granted to Hindi the status of the Official Language of the Republic of India.

    <h1> Punjabi</h1>
    
    
    <p>Punjabi is one of India's 22 official languages. The Punjabi language is spoken by over 100 million people worldwide; about 90 million in the larger Punjab, a territory that was divided between India and Pakistan by the British during the 1947 partition. 
    Another 10 million Punjabi speaking communities are spread throughout Canada, United Kingdom, the United States, Malaysia, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates and elsewhere.   

In linguistic terms, Punjabi language is classified as a member of the Indo-Aryan subgroup of the prehistoric Proto-Indo-European family of languages (See attached "Roots of World Languages Chart").   

The Punjabi language is a descendent of the Shauraseni Prakrit, a language of medieval northern India that was used primarily in drama and plays during the 3rd to 10th centuries. 
It is believed Punjabi developed as an evolution from the Shauraseni-Prakrit-Apabhramsha languages around the 11th century, with some influence from the pre-Indo-Aryan languages on its phonology and morphology.   

Punjabi’s uniqueness lies in the use of tones by which words are differentiated that are otherwise the same. The language uses three contour tones; these tones change over the course of a word. 
Tones in Punjabi are realized over two successive syllables and are expressed phonetically as high rising-falling, mid rising-falling and very low rising.   

Dialects of Punjabi 
The key dialects of Punjabi in India include: Majhi, Doabi, Malwai and Powadhi that have regional Hindi/Sanskrit influence on the main Punjabi language. 
In Pakistan, the regional Sindhi language influences the main Punjabi language resulting in dialects such as Majhi, Pothohari, Hindko and Multani. 
Pakistani Punjabi also has Persian, Central Asian and Arabic vocabulary influences.   

To write Punjabi, one can use three alphabets – namely, Gurmukhi, Shahmukhi and Devanagri to a lesser extent. The name Gurmukhi means "from the mouth of the Guru," Shahmukhi translates to “from King’s mouth” and Devanagri implies “The container of divine light.”    <br>
